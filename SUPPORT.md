# Support Resources 🆘

Thank you for using OptiCore! Here are the recommended ways to get help or share feedback.

## 🔍 Self-Service

- Review the latest `README.md` for installation and usage instructions.
- Search existing issues and discussions for known problems or workarounds.
- Check release notes for recent fixes or behavioural changes.
- Inspect inline comments in the relevant PHP/JS files if you are comfortable reading code; most features are documented next to their implementation.

## 🐞 Filing Issues

Use the GitHub issue tracker for:

- Bugs or regressions.
- Documentation corrections.
- Feature requests and optimisation ideas.

When opening a new issue, it helps a lot if you:

- Include WordPress/PHP versions and your active theme.
- Attach the relevant OptiCore settings (screenshot or export).
- Describe clear reproduction steps.
- Paste any error messages or logs where possible.

## 🔒 Security Reports

Do not file public issues for security problems. Instead, follow the process described in `SECURITY.md`.

## 💼 Commercial Support

At this time there is no commercial support offering. If you are interested in sponsoring development or requesting bespoke features, open a discussion to coordinate.
